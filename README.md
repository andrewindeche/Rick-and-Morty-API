<p>The ReadME documents details for the Implementation of an Application built using using Rick and Morty API </p>

## <h1> Description</h1>
<p>The Aim of the project is to build a React.js/Next.js web application that uses the Rick and Morty API and is based on the Rick and Morty cartoon series. The project displays Rick and Morty characters on criteria basis of character name, location name, and episode name</p>

## Tool Implementation Choices/Decisions
<p><b>Github</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Github was used as a default repository for storing the codebase.It is popular, allows for collaboration and reviews, it allows for integration of other CI/CD tools and versioning for building of scalable applications</li>
</ul>
<p><b>NextJs</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The project was built using NextJs, A React Based Javascript FrontEnd Framework. A minimal NextJs App was used to build the application from scratch for efficiency in space uilization and simplicity in the Application functionality.
<b>Configuration Process</b>
<ul>
<li> Creation of a new directory and initialization of Package.json using npm init</li>
<li> Dependency installations (npm v.10.4.0 and node v.21.4.0)</li>
<li> Building up of components for reusable code and pages for routing </li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><b>ESLint</b></p>
<ul>
<li>ESLint was configured for Typescript used for linting the Application's syntax. It is an efficient and popular tool for checking language rules in Javascript</li>
</ul>
<p><b>MySql</b></p>
<ul>
<li>MySql relational database has been used for storing consistent information/notes regarding a character.It is opensource, popular,run on multiple environments</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Figma</b></p>
<ul>The design implemantation was implemented using Figma, an online tool for designing wireframes and Prototypes.It is a user friendly and simple tool used for designing</ul>
<p></p>

## Design Implementation
<p><b>Colors</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Shades of Green (Monochromatic colors) #55BB25 and #518D34 were dominant throughout the project as they are the main brand colors of Rick and Morty</li>
<li>Orange #F7825E and Red #AC3131 were also used as complementary colors to the main colors to add an accent  and  break monotony in the color scheme</li>
<li>White was also used to break cognitive overload of bright colors,to enable visibility of text in the case of dull colors and to bring focus to the searchbar which is the main interactive User Interface element</li>
<li>Black color was also used on fonts to bring contract/focus to text in the case of using bright colors</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Font Style</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Creepster font was used in the project as it is the theme font for the Ricka and Morty series</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Animation</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Moving stars were used on the navbar to capture emotive interest of a user.</li>
<li>Images with slideshow animation effects were used to showcase different characters in the Rick and Morty series and to also capture the emotive interest of users</li>
</ul>

## <h1> Commands for Running the Project</h1>
## Development server

Run `npm run dev` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `touch component.tsx` to generate a new component. The pages are located in the pages directory and are useful in routing while the components are located in a components directory for modularity and reusability.

## Build

Run `next build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `.next` directory.

## Run Linter

Run`npm run lint` to execute linting of the Next Js application. The dependency can be configured using `npm install` command.
